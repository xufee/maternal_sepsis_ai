# SepsisGuard: AI-Powered Early Warning System for Post-Cesarean Sepsis Detection
by Zainab Umar Faruq FE/23/14748402 &  Umar Lawal Jari FE/23/33736272

# OBJECTIVE
A Python-based clinical AI system that predicts maternal sepsis risk in post-cesarean patients using synthetic vital signs data, showcasing end-to-end machine learning development with interpretable LLM explanations. Designed as a healthcare AI proof-of-concept that demonstrates real-world clinical decision support capabilities.

# WHY IT MATTERS 
Sepsis after C-section delivery kills thousands of mothers annually, yet 80% of these deaths are preventable with early detection. Our AI system demonstrates how machine learning can transform routine vital signs into life-saving risk assessments, giving healthcare teams the critical window needed to intervene.
